## What we learned

This project has been an invaluable learning experience, enabling us to develop and hone our technical skills and knowledge, problem-solving abilities, and collaborative communication as a team. Through its completion, we have gained practical experience in agile development, as well as learning new technologies and implementation strategies. Moreover, we have acquired the ability to debug and test our code, and most importantly, learned how to communicate and collaborate effectively as individual members of an engineering team.
